# AI Context Management

## Overview

Strategies for efficient AI context handling that minimize token usage while preserving comprehensive information access through modular design and smart context loading.

## Core Principles

### 1. Modular Context Loading
**Problem**: AI agents loading entire documentation in every interaction wastes tokens and hits context limits.

**Solution**: Load only what's needed for specific tasks.
```markdown
# Instead of reading everything
docs/ (entire folder)

# Read specific modules
docs/section/AGENTS.md (process only)
docs/project-knowledge-base/specific-context.md (if needed)
```

### 2. 10-Line Summary Pattern
**Problem**: Determining if a file contains needed information requires reading the entire file.

**Solution**: Standardized summary format in first 10 lines.
```markdown
## Summary (Lines 1-10)
Purpose: What this file covers
Key information: Most critical data points  
Current status: State for decision-making
Context: Essential background for AI understanding
Next steps: Immediate actions or priorities
Covers: Specific topics addressed
Critical rules: Must-know requirements
Main workflow: Primary process flow
Status: Current implementation state
Next: Immediate action required
```

### 3. Context Hierarchy
**Problem**: Different tasks need different levels of detail.

**Solution**: Tiered information access.
```
Level 1: AGENTS.md (20-50 lines) - Process and immediate context
Level 2: README.md - Human summary and navigation  
Level 3: Detailed docs - Complete information
Level 4: AI Knowledge Base - Technical context for AI decisions
```

## Implementation Strategies

### File Organization for Context Efficiency

#### Section Access Pattern
```markdown
## Core Rules
- **Section Access Rule**: MUST read section AGENTS.md before working in any docs section
```

This ensures AI agents:
1. Understand section-specific processes
2. Load appropriate context for the task
3. Follow established workflows
4. Avoid reinventing processes

#### AI Knowledge Base Structure
```
docs/project-knowledge-base/
├── README.md (AI ONLY warning + navigation)
├── AGENTS.md (Knowledge base maintenance)
├── development-processes.md (Git, testing, deployment)
├── architecture-context.md (System design, components)
├── implementation-status.md (Completion tracking)
├── configuration-reference.md (Environment, settings)
├── troubleshooting-database.md (Common issues, solutions)
└── [other-modules].md
```

Each file optimized for:
- **Token efficiency**: Dense information without fluff
- **Quick scanning**: 10-line summaries for context determination
- **Modular access**: Self-contained context for specific domains
- **AI consumption**: Formatted for LLM understanding

### Context Loading Workflows

#### Task-Specific Loading
```markdown
# For documentation updates
1. Read main AGENTS.md (core rules)
2. Read section AGENTS.md (specific process)  
3. Scan relevant knowledge base module summary
4. Load full module only if needed

# For implementation work
1. Read main AGENTS.md (core rules)
2. Read technical-guides/AGENTS.md (technical process)
3. Load architecture-context.md (system understanding)
4. Load specific technical guides as needed
```

#### Efficient Context Determination
```markdown
# Quick context assessment
1. Read 10-line summary of potential files
2. Determine relevance to current task
3. Load full content only for relevant files
4. Use cross-references to find related information
```

## Token Optimization Techniques

### Content Density
**AI Knowledge Base Example**:
```markdown
# Dense, actionable content
Current state: Services down, need first deployment
Stack: Proxy (3001) → MCPServer (3000) → FalkorDB (6379)
Auth: OAuth 2.1 Bearer tokens, RSA JWT validation
Tools: 4 MCP tools implemented and tested
Next: docker-compose up -d, test integration
```

**Not**: Verbose explanations with filler content

### Smart Cross-Referencing
```markdown
# Efficient references
See docs/technical-guides/architecture.md for system design details

# Not: Duplicating content across files
```

### Context Preservation
```markdown
# Essential context in summaries
Status: 98% complete, ready for deployment
Gap: MCPServer lacks embedding tools (solution: async job)
Current: All vector operations work via falkordb_query tool
```

## Implementation Benefits

### Demonstrated Results

#### Token Usage Reduction
- **Main AGENTS.md**: 49 lines (vs 125+ lines before modularization)
- **Context loading**: Only relevant sections loaded per task
- **Summary scanning**: Quick determination of file relevance
- **Modular access**: Specific information without full context reload

#### Maintained Information Quality
- **Complete coverage**: All information preserved in appropriate locations
- **AI accessibility**: Optimized format for LLM consumption
- **Human usability**: Clear navigation and summaries for human users
- **Process clarity**: Defined workflows for different tasks

### Productivity Gains
- **Faster context loading**: AI spends less time reading irrelevant information
- **Better decision making**: Relevant context readily available
- **Reduced cognitive overhead**: Clear structure prevents information overload
- **Scalable approach**: Patterns work as project grows

## Best Practices

### For AI Knowledge Base Files
```markdown
1. Start with 10-line summary
2. Use information-dense formatting
3. Focus on decision-making context
4. Avoid human-comfort formatting
5. Include cross-references for related information
```

### For Section AGENTS.md Files
```markdown
1. Keep under 50 lines (target), 100 lines max
2. Focus on process instructions
3. Include section-specific context
4. Define clear maintenance workflows
5. Reference detailed docs for complete information
```

### For Context Loading
```markdown
1. Always read section AGENTS.md first
2. Scan summaries before full file reading
3. Load modules based on specific task needs
4. Use cross-references to find related information
5. Update knowledge base when gathering new information
```

## Adaptation Guidelines

### Project Customization

#### File Structure
- **Adapt to project size**: Smaller projects may need fewer knowledge modules
- **Technology alignment**: Adjust context categories for specific tech stacks
- **Team workflow**: Align with existing development processes
- **Tool integration**: Connect with current documentation tools

#### Content Organization
- **Domain-specific modules**: Create knowledge files for project-specific areas
- **Summary standards**: Establish 10-line summary format for team
- **Context hierarchy**: Define appropriate detail levels for project needs
- **Cross-reference patterns**: Establish linking conventions

## Common Pitfalls

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Context bloat**: Loading unnecessary information for specific tasks
- **Duplicate content**: Maintaining same information in multiple places
- **Missing summaries**: Files without quick context determination
- **Monolithic files**: Large files that require full reading for any information

### Quality Indicators
- **Fast context loading**: AI can quickly determine relevant information
- **Efficient task completion**: Minimal token usage for specific operations
- **Maintained quality**: All necessary information remains accessible
- **Clear navigation**: Both AI and humans can find information efficiently
