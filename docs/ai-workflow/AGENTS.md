# AI Workflow - AI Instructions

## Documentation Hierarchy
- **AGENTS.md** (This file): AI-specific workflow documentation maintenance
- **README.md**: Human-readable AI workflow guide and navigation
- **Workflow files**: Detailed processes for AI-human collaboration patterns

## AI Context for Workflow Section
Documentation of AI-human collaboration patterns established in this repository.
Serves as reference for other users/repositories wanting to implement similar workflows.
Contains modular documentation approach, ticket management, and collaboration standards.

## AI Maintenance Process
1. **Read this AGENTS.md**: Before any ai-workflow documentation work
2. **Document patterns**: Capture successful AI-human collaboration workflows
3. **Update examples**: Keep workflow examples current with actual practices
4. **Extract lessons**: Document what works well and what to avoid
5. **Update README.md**: Sync human navigation when workflows are added/modified

## Workflow Documentation Focus
- **Modular Documentation**: 3-tier hierarchy (AGENTS.md, README.md, detailed)
- **Ticket Management**: State-based organization with file movement
- **AI Context Efficiency**: Token optimization and 10-line summaries
- **Collaboration Patterns**: Successful AI-human development workflows
- **Repository Structure**: How to organize docs for AI consumption

## AI Update Triggers
- New collaboration patterns established (document workflow)
- Successful AI workflow optimizations (update best practices)
- Documentation structure improvements (update modular approach guides)
- Tool/process changes (update workflow documentation)

## Content Standards (AI Guidelines)
- **Practical Focus**: Document actual working patterns, not theoretical
- **Reproducible**: Provide clear steps others can follow
- **Evidence-Based**: Include examples from this repository's success
- **Human-Accessible**: Structure for developers wanting to adopt these patterns
