**Status**: Concept Only (Not Planned)  
**Priority**: Not Applicable  
**Category**: User Experience Concepts  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks (if ever implemented)  

## Overview

A visual, web-based GraphQL query builder that allows users to construct complex Cypher queries through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, with real-time query preview and execution.
