# Project Knowledge Base

This folder contains files primarily meant for AI consumption to maintain a modular context workflow. These files store detailed technical knowledge, implementation decisions, and contextual information that supports the main documentation.

## Purpose
- **AI Context**: Provide detailed context for AI assistants without cluttering main docs
- **Modular Approach**: Allow main AGENTS.md to stay compact while preserving detailed knowledge
- **Technical Reference**: Store implementation details, decisions, and troubleshooting info

## File Organization
- **Technical Details**: Implementation specifics too detailed for main docs
- **Decision Records**: Architecture decisions and rationale
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
- **Context Files**: Background information for AI assistants

## Usage
- AI assistants should refer to these files when main docs lack sufficient detail
- Update these files when gathering information not available in main docs
- Keep main user-facing docs in parent `docs/` folder clean and focused
