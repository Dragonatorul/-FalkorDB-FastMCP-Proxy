# Project Knowledge Base - AI ONLY

⚠️ **FOR AI AGENT CONSUMPTION ONLY** ⚠️

This folder contains detailed technical information maintained exclusively by AI agents for AI context and decision-making. Human users should refer to the main documentation in other `docs/` sections.

## Purpose
- **AI Context Storage**: Detailed technical knowledge for AI agent decision-making
- **Implementation Details**: Low-level technical information too detailed for human docs
- **Decision Records**: AI reasoning and architectural decision context
- **Troubleshooting Database**: AI-accessible problem-solution mappings

## Content Types
- **Technical Specifications**: Implementation details and constraints
- **Decision Context**: Background information for AI architectural decisions
- **Process Knowledge**: AI workflow patterns and established practices
- **Reference Data**: Lookup tables, configuration examples, error mappings

## AI Maintenance Guidelines
- Update when gathering new technical knowledge not in main docs
- Store implementation decisions and reasoning for future reference
- Maintain duplicate information if needed for AI context efficiency
- Cross-reference main docs when appropriate but prioritize AI comprehension

## Human Users
**Please refer to other documentation sections:**
- `docs/technical-guides/` - Technical implementation guides
- `docs/user-guides/` - Setup and usage instructions
- `docs/project-management/` - Feature and issue tracking
- `docs/exploratory-analysis/` - Vector implementation analysis
