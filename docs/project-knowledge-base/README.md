# Project Knowledge Base - AI ONLY

⚠️ **FOR AI AGENT CONSUMPTION ONLY** ⚠️

This folder contains modular technical knowledge optimized for AI context efficiency. Each file has a 10-line summary for quick scanning. Human users should refer to main documentation sections.

## AI Knowledge Modules

### Process Knowledge
- **[development-processes.md](development-processes.md)** - Git workflow, commit standards, testing, deployment
- **[ticket-management-context.md](ticket-management-context.md)** - Feature/issue lifecycle and state management

### Technical Context
- **[architecture-context.md](architecture-context.md)** - System components, authentication flow, network topology
- **[configuration-reference.md](configuration-reference.md)** - Environment variables, deployment configs, multi-tenancy
- **[implementation-status.md](implementation-status.md)** - Component completion matrix and readiness tracking

### Specialized Knowledge
- **[vector-implementation-context.md](vector-implementation-context.md)** - Vector capabilities, implementation gap, async job solution
- **[troubleshooting-database.md](troubleshooting-database.md)** - Common issues, debugging workflows, error solutions

## AI Usage Guidelines
1. **Scan First**: Read 10-line summary to determine if full file needed
2. **Modular Access**: Each file is self-contained for specific context
3. **Efficient Context**: Optimized for minimal token usage while preserving information
4. **Update When**: Gathering new knowledge not available in main docs
5. **Cross-Reference**: Link to main docs when directing humans to information

## Content Organization
- **10-Line Summaries**: Essential info in first 10 lines for quick scanning
- **Compact Format**: Token-efficient while maintaining comprehensiveness  
- **Modular Structure**: Each file addresses specific knowledge domain
- **AI-Optimized**: Formatted for LLM consumption and decision-making

## Human Users - Please Refer To:
- **User Guides**: Setup and usage instructions
- **Technical Guides**: Implementation and architecture details
- **Project Management**: Feature and issue tracking
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Vector implementation research
