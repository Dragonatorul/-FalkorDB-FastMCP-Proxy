# Features Tracking

Features organized by status with one file per feature. Files moved between state folders as development progresses.

## Status Structure
```
features/
├── concept/        # Ideas, not planned for implementation
├── planned/        # Approved for development
├── in-progress/    # Currently being developed
└── completed/      # Implemented and tested
```

## Current Features
- **Concept**: 3 features (enterprise ideas, not planned)
- **Planned**: 0 features
- **In Progress**: 0 features
- **Completed**: 1 feature (CI/CD pipeline)

## Feature Management Process
1. **Create**: New feature in concept/ folder
2. **Plan**: Move to planned/ when approved for development
3. **Develop**: Move to in-progress/ when starting work
4. **Complete**: Move to completed/ when implemented and tested

## Feature Headers Required
```markdown
**Status**: [Concept/Planned/In-Progress/Completed]
**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low/Not Applicable]
**Category**: [Core/Enhancement/Enterprise/Integration]
**Estimated Effort**: [Time estimate]
```

See `docs/project-management/AGENTS.md` for detailed ticket management process.

## Current Planned Features

### High Priority (Actually Planned)
- **[cicd-pipeline-docker-semver.md](./cicd-pipeline-docker-semver.md)** - GitHub Actions CI/CD with semantic versioning (for personal use)

### Concept Only (Not Planned - Enterprise Ideas)
> **⚠️ The following are concept documents only** - These enterprise-grade features are far outside the scope of the current personal-use project and are not planned for implementation in the foreseeable future.

- **[web-ui-user-management.md](./web-ui-user-management.md)** - Enterprise web-based administration interface  
- **[graphql-query-builder.md](./graphql-query-builder.md)** - Advanced visual query construction interface
- **[collaborative-queries.md](./collaborative-queries.md)** - Real-time collaborative query editing

### Future Considerations (Not Planned)
- **Advanced Analytics Dashboard** - Business intelligence and reporting (enterprise concept)
- **Mobile Administration App** - Native mobile interface (enterprise concept)  
- **API Gateway Integration** - Centralized API management (enterprise concept)
- **Machine Learning Insights** - AI-powered optimization (enterprise concept)
- **Backup & Recovery System** - Enterprise disaster recovery (enterprise concept)
- **Multi-Region Deployment** - Geographic distribution (enterprise concept)

## Feature Template

When proposing new features, follow this structure:

```markdown
# Feature: [Title]

**Status**: [Planned/In Development/Completed]  
**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]  
**Category**: [Category Name]  
**Estimated Effort**: [Time estimate]  

## Overview
[Brief description of the feature]

## Business Case
[Why this feature is valuable]

## Technical Specification
[How the feature will be implemented]

## Success Criteria
[Measurable criteria for completion]

## Dependencies
[Required features or systems]

## Implementation Phases
[Breakdown of development phases]
```

## Feature Development Process

1. **Proposal**: Create detailed feature specification
2. **Review**: Evaluate business value and technical feasibility
3. **Prioritize**: Assign priority based on business needs
4. **Plan**: Break down into implementable phases
5. **Develop**: Implement according to specification
6. **Test**: Validate against success criteria
7. **Deploy**: Release to production environment

## Integration Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Include comprehensive tests for new features
- Document all public APIs and interfaces
- Follow semantic versioning for releases

### Security Considerations
- Security review required for all features
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

### Performance Standards
- Features must not degrade system performance
- Load testing required for user-facing features
- Memory usage monitoring and optimization
- Database query optimization and indexing

## Feature Lifecycle

### Status Definitions
- **Planned**: Documented but not yet started
- **In Development**: Active development in progress
- **Testing**: Feature complete, undergoing validation
- **Completed**: Deployed and fully functional
- **Deprecated**: No longer supported or maintained

### Review Checkpoints
- **Design Review**: Architecture and approach validation
- **Security Review**: Security implications assessment  
- **Performance Review**: Performance impact evaluation
- **User Experience Review**: Usability and design validation
- **Final Review**: Complete feature validation before release
