# Production requirements with exact versions and hashes
# Generated from base.txt using pip-compile
# 
# To update: pip-compile requirements/base.txt --output-file requirements/prod.txt --generate-hashes
#
# This file should contain:
# 1. Exact versions (==) instead of ranges (>=)
# 2. SHA256 hashes for security verification
# 3. All transitive dependencies explicitly listed
# 4. Only production dependencies (no dev/test tools)

-r base.txt

# This file should be generated using pip-compile for production deployments
# Example command:
# pip-compile requirements/base.txt --output-file requirements/prod.txt --generate-hashes --no-emit-index-url

# For now, use base.txt until pip-compile is run
